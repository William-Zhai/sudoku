# sudoku
The project is used to build one sudoku game with native Javascript, JQuery, Vue, Express and Node.

At first step, I will set up the game with native Javascript, express and node.
Then, I will use the JQuery to replace the Native Javascript.
At last, I will realize the game with vue framework.

If you have any advice about my idea, please free to let me know.

Later, I will add the detailed info about my project.

The first step is as below:
    1. realize the post request for new sudoku via ajax using native Javascript( issue met: for the content-type of HTTP header, it's better to make sure application/json is used in both sides. )
