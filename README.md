# sudoku
The project is used to build one sudoku game with Javascript Native, JQuery, Vue, Express and Node.

At first step, I will set up the game with native Javascript, express and node.
Then, I will use the JQuery to replace the Native Javascript.
At last, I will relize the game with vue framework.

If you have any advice about my idea, please free to let me know.

Later, I will add the detailed info about my project.
